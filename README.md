JBA JS project <b>Open Space</b>

## Learning outcomes
The project covers the basics of JS, HTML, and CSS. You will learn how to position and design elements, work with different inputs, and even create animation using JS.

## About
Have you ever dreamt about exploring deep space? In this project, you'll create a simple web game where you launch a rocket from an uninhabited planet. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to complete this project: we will start from the ground up by learning how to implement an HTML skeleton of a page and use CSS. Then, we'll learn how to make the game interactive with JS, and by the end of the project, you'll have a firm knowledge foundation for developing your frontend skills.
